# Synopsis:
            "Creating a regristration app for a company,using Python and GUI."

The topic requires us to create an app that allows humn beings or users of the internet to register for a certain company,whilst providing needed personal information for the registration process.This app's creation shall involve usage of python programming language,tkinter.

In today's modern data era,the old paper and pen methods of regristration have become suboptimal,as a result the world hasted to apps and webpages for the same purpose.Thus,catering to usefulness and availability of resources,we have chosen this topic.

The premises of this project requires us to create an app that accepts basic necessary credentials for a certain company,after which certain terms and conditions are agreed upon.After registration,the registered candidates receive a regristration number.This app also stores the list of all the registered candidates,which may be accessed by certain authorities.

For starters,the project uses tkinter as its environment(work in progress)
