# Synopsis:
            "Creating a regristration app for a company,using Python and GUI."

The vision of this project is to create an app that enables all users to register for a certain company,whilst providing essential details/information for the registration process.

In today's modern era,the old pen and paper methods of registration have become suboptimal when compared with their electronic counterpart viz apps and webpages.Thus,catering to the usefulness and availability of resources,we have chosen tho generalise the basic module as much as we could for ease of convenience of our users.

One of the key featues of this product is that it can also generate a persistance list of all the registered candidates,which could be accessed by the user in a later time.

This app's creation shall involve usage of python module:
tkinter
csvreader
os
numpy
